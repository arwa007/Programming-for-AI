#You have a dictionary where each key is a student’s name and each value is a list of their grades. You need to perform the following operations:
# • Add a new grade to a student's list of grades.
# • Calculate and print the average grade for a specific student.
# • Add a new student with an initial empty list of grades.
# • Remove a student from the dictionary
