#Write a program to make a simple calculator performing the four basic operations (+, -, *, /) on two numbers input by user. The following conditionsmustbe satisfied:
# a) A ‘+’ sign must not be used foraddition.
# b) You can only use a maximum of 3 variables. No more variables are allowed.
# c) Your program should ask the user which operation he/she wants to perform and gives the output accordingly.

num1 = float(input("Enter Number 1\n"))
num2 = float(input("Enter Number 2\n"))
op = (input("Enter the Operator\n"))

if op == '+':
    print(num1-(-num2))
elif op == '-':
    print(num1-num2)
elif op == '/':
    print(num1/num2)
elif op == '*' or op == 'x':
    print(num1*num2)
